I really really love the city lights theme. I'm new to coding, and I've been playing around with SASS/CSS and I can't stand some of the bland colors. I added some colors, but I didn't want to compromise the look and feel of City Lights, so I made sure they were subtle and soft colors. I'll make changes as I continue, but so far the HTML looks great with no complaints! Maybe once I get better, I'll make an actual extension for easy installation. 
Here is a small comparison of what I changed. https://i.imgur.com/KPgRFZ8.jpg

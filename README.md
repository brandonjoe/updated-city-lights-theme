I really really love the city lights theme. I'm new to coding, and I've been playing around with SASS and I can't stand some of the blank colors. I updated some colors, and I'll update this as I continue to learn more. So far this color scheme is super easy on my eyes, and I with a few color changes, it's easier for me to find values. 
Here is a small comparison of what I changed. https://i.imgur.com/KPgRFZ8.jpg

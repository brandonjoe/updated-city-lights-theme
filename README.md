I really love the [City Lights](http://citylights.xyz/) theme by [YummyGummy](https://yummygum.com/). I've been playing around with SASS/CSS and I can't stand some of the bland colors. I added some colors, but I didn't want to compromise the look and feel of City Lights, so I made sure they were subtle and soft colors. I'll make changes more changes in the future where needed, but so far the HTML looks great with no complaints! Maybe later I'll make an actual extension for easy installation. 
Here is a small comparison of what I changed. https://i.imgur.com/KPgRFZ8.jpg
